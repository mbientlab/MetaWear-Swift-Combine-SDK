// These contracts interact with
// MetaWear modules with type safety and
// code completion.
//
// You can ignore the protocol's contents,
// but do know the log, stream, read, and
// command action types, as these are how
// to interact with MetaWears.
//
// Each module differs in capabilities,
// customizations, and the C++ methods
// required to operate them. Some also
// have multiple sensor models with different
// capabilities. Objects implementing
// these protocols abstract that away
// from you â€” and provide a
// reference when you need to write
// your own abstractions.


// MARK: - Log

/// Sensors that can log data to onboard storage adhere to this protocol
/// to configure, start, stop, and download the logger.
///
/// To start logging, use the `.log()` operators. These are
/// available on a `Publisher` whose output is a `MetaWear`, including:
/// - ``MetaWear/MetaWear/publish()``
/// - ``MetaWear/MetaWear/publishIfConnected()``
/// - ``MetaWear/MetaWear/publishWhenConnected()``
///
/// These operators accept `MWLoggable` instances construct by
/// autocompletion, such as ``MWLoggable/sensorFusionQuaternion(mode:)``,
/// or by direct construction, such as `MWSensorFusion` ``MWSensorFusion/Quaternion/init(mode:)``.
///
/// ```swift
/// metawear
///    .publishWhenConnected()
///    .first()
///    .mapToMWError() // Changes Failure from Never to MWError
///    .log(.sensorFusionQuaternion(mode: .ndof)
///    .log(.gyroscope(range: .dps2000, frequency: .hz400)
///    .sink { _ in }
///    .store(in: &subs)
/// ```
///
/// Direct construction may be useful when you persist user selected settings
/// or organize arbitrarily large logging sessions. The SDK includes the operators
/// `.macro(executeOnBoot:)` and `.optionallyLog` to help with this.
///
/// ```swift
/// let pressure = MWBarometer.MWPressure(standby: .ms125, iir: .off, oversampling: .standard)
/// let gyro = MWGyroscope(range: .dps1000, frequency: .hz400)
/// let euler: MWSensorFusion.EulerAngles? = nil
///
/// metawear
///     .publishIfConnected()
///     .macro(executeOnBoot: true) { metawear in
///          metawear
///             .optionallyLog(euler)
///             .optionallyLog(gyro)

// MARK: - Stream

/// Sensors that can stream data at about 100 to 120 Hz
/// adhere to this protocol to configure, start, and stop a

///
/// To start a stream, use the `.stream()` operators. They are available
/// on a `Publisher` whose output is a `MetaWear`, including:
/// - ``MetaWear/MetaWear/publish()``
/// - ``MetaWear/MetaWear/publishIfConnected()``
/// - ``MetaWear/MetaWear/publishWhenConnected()``
///
/// A `.stream()` operator accepts an `MWStreamable` instance.
/// You can use presets that autocomplete within the operator,
/// such as ``MWStreamable/magnetometer(freq:)``, or construct
/// them directly, such as ``MWMagnetometer/init(freq:)``.
///
/// Some `.stream()` operators produce a timestamped typed output.
/// You can collect these into an array and convert that into a
/// String-only CSV table with aptly labeled columns by using
/// ``MWDataTable``, such as in the example below.
///
/// ```swift
/// let cancel = PassthroughSubject<Void,Never>()
/// let config: MWStreamable = .magnetometer(freq: .hz25)
/// metawear
///     .publishIfConnected()
///     .stream(config)
///     .prefix(untilOutputFrom: cancel)
///     .collect()
///     .map { MWDataTable(streamed: $0, config) }
///     .eraseToAnyPublisher()
/// ```
///
/// Multiple `.stream` pipelines can run independently. You
/// can also merge the output of an arbitrary array of streams
/// using standard operators like `MergeMany`, `.prefix(untilOutputFrom:)`,
/// and `.collect()` . Our open-source **MetaBase 5** app provides an
/// example in [ActionVM.swift](https://github.com/mbientlab/MetaBase/blob/6bc70d01be561565de2755c85c810d784ef68760/Shared/Screens/4_Action/VMs/ActionVM.swift#L276). It uses user-selected (and persisted) sensor parameters
/// to inform the construction a container of `MWStreamable` configurations.
/// Only non-nil configs are streamed. Upon cancellation, outputs merge
/// into a single CSV file. The hyperlinked function is called as
/// part of a loop across an arbitrary number of devices.

/// and default methods are unlikely to be important to you.
